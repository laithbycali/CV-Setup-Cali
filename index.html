                    <p class="text-container">As the founder and owner of PHYNE Restaurant and Bar in Cologne, it was my
                        responsibility to develop
                        and execute the concept and vision of the business. From January 2017 to December 2019, I played
                        a
                        key role in creating an inviting atmosphere where guests could enjoy a high-quality culinary
                        experience and a unique entertainment experience. In my role as owner, I was responsible for
                        creating the food and cocktail menus, which I personally wrote and designed. Additionally, I was
                        in
                        charge of organizing live music performances and managing the sound system. I worked closely
                        with
                        our team to ensure that the service was always of the highest quality and that all guests were
                        satisfied with an unforgettable experience. My experience as the founder and owner of PHYNE
                        Restaurant and Bar has provided me with valuable skills and knowledge in areas such as business
                        management, marketing, customer service, and event organization. I am proud to have built a
                        successful business and look forward to applying my experiences and skills to future
                        professional
                        challenges.

                        2019
                        in selling high-quality
                        CBD in various forms such as oils, capsules, creams, and teas, promoting a healthy lifestyle for
                        people of all ages. In addition, I was responsible for conducting comprehensive market research
                        analyses, providing valuable insights into the market and making informed decisions. In my role
                        as a
                        co-founder, I was also responsible for developing new products. In our laboratory, I created my
                        own
                        CBD-based skin creams, which have been highly popular. We worked hard to establish our business
                        successfully in the market, focusing on quality and customer satisfaction. My experience as a
                        co-founder of Hanfgrün.de has given me valuable skills in business start-up, product
                        development,
                        marketing, sales, and customer service. I am proud to be involved in creating a company that has
                        a
                        positive impact on people's lives and look forward to continuing to contribute to making
                        Hanfgrün.de
                        a leading provider of high-quality CBD.

                    <p class="text-container">As a co-founder of Lvly-menu.com, also known as Lovly Menu, I had the
                        privilege of participating in a
                        significant project from February 2020 to March 2021. We developed the first digital menu in
                        Germany
                        for the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed guests to record their contact information through a QR
                        code and comply with COVID-19 guidelines. Additionally, it enabled our partners to display
                        targeted
                        advertising, which was a win-win situation for both our customers and partners. During my
                        involvement with Lovly Menu, we worked closely with sponsors such as Schweppes, Campari, Brown &
                        Formers - Jack Daniels, Holiday in Hotels, and other companies to expand our reach and improve
                        our
                        distribution opportunities. This collaboration allowed us to make a free contribution to support
                        the
                        gastronomy industry and offer our customers a better experience. My responsibilities for this
                        project included engaging in conversations with various spirit companies (brands), which I could
                        leverage my contacts from my own business with PHYNE Restaurant & Bar. Additionally, I was one
                        of
                        the creative minds behind this idea that we worked on with our team. My experiences as a
                        co-founder
                        at Lovly Menu have strengthened my skills in project management, business development, and
                        collaboration with sponsors and partners. I am proud to have been a part of this project and
                        look
                        forward to applying my experiences and skills in future endeavors.
